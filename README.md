# Zitwit: Share Your Updates with the World

Welcome to Zitwit, a microblogging platform designed for developers and tech enthusiasts to share short updates, tips, and news in the tech world. Zitwit allows users to easily post updates and integrate them with social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, making it easier to spread your word across multiple channels.

## Technology Stack

Zitwit leverages modern web development technologies to offer a seamless and efficient user experience:

- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and enhancing the development workflow.
- **SWC**: For super-fast TypeScript transformation and optimization.


# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
